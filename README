Build instructions:

    * Edit the Makefile to set an appopriate prefix;
      the default is to install in ~/bin and ~/lib.
    * make configure
    * make install, to install just the API, or make epic_install to
      install the command line compiler, 'epic'. 

The command line tool, epic takes a source file and produces executable
code, via C. Separate compilation is supported, in a fairly simple
way, e.g. to compile a main program main.e which includes some
functions defined in lib.e:

    * Build lib.o with the command epic -c lib.e.
    * Import functions in main.e with the line include "lib.ei" in the source.
    * Build the executable with epic main.e lib.o -o main
