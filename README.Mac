For gcc to know where to look on the Mac for include and library
files, assuming you are installing epic in the default location in
your home directory, you will need something like the following in
your .profile:

export C_INCLUDE_PATH=~/include:/opt/local/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=~/include:/opt/local/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/lib:/opt/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
export INCLUDE_PATH=~/include:/opt/local/include:$INCLUDE_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=~/lib:/opt/local/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
