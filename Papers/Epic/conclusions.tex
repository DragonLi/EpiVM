\section{Related Work}

Should mention Agda and Idris~\cite{scrap-engine} and the development
version of Epigram~\cite{levitation} as having Epic back ends.

GHC's run-time system~\cite{stg, evalpush}, ABC
machine~\cite{abc-machine} and why we don't just use one of them
(no useful interface, imposes constraints on the type system).
Some influence from GRIN~\cite{grin-project}.

Lazy virtual machine~\cite{lvm}. C-~~\cite{c--} and LLVM~\cite{llvm}
as possible code generation strategies. Supercompilation for
optimisations~\cite{mitchell-super}.
