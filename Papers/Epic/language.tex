\section{The Epic Language}

Epic is based on the $\lambda$-calculus with some extensions.
It supports primitives such as strings and integers, as well as tagged
unions. There are additional control structures for specifying
evaluation order, primitive loop constructs, and calling foreign
functions. Foreign function calls are annotated with types, to assist
with marshaling values between Epic and C, but otherwise there are no
type annotations and there is no type checking --- as Epic is intended
as an intermediate language, it is assumed that the high level
language has already performed any necessary type checking. The
abstract syntax of the core language is given in Figure \ref{epicsyn}.
As a shorthand, we use de Bruijn telescope notation, $\tx$, to denote
a sequence of $\vx$.

\subsection{Definitions}

An Epic program consists of a sequence of \remph{untyped} function
definitions, with zero or more arguments. The entry point is the
function $\VV{main}$, which takes no arguments. For example:

\DM{
\begin{array}{ll}
\VV{factorial}(\vx)&\:=\:
\RW{if}\:\vx==0\:\AR{\RW{then}\:1\\
\RW{else}\:\vx\:\times\:\VV{factorial}(\vx-1)}
\medskip
\\
\VV{main}()&\:=\:\VV{putStrLn}(\VV{intToString}(\VV{factorial}(10)))
\end{array}
} 

\noindent
The right hand side of a definition is an expression consisting of
function applications, operators (arithmetic, comparison, and
bit-shifting), bindings and control structures (some low level and
imperative).  Functions may be \remph{partially applied}, i.e. applied
to fewer arguments than they require. Evaluating a partially applied
function results in a function which expects the remaining arguments.

\subsubsection*{Values}

Values in an Epic program are either one of the primitives (an
integer, floating point number, character, boolean or string) or a
\remph{tagged union}. Tagged unions are of the form $\DC{Con}
\vi(\vt_1,\ldots,\vt_n)$, where $\vi$ is the \remph{tag} and the $\ta$
are the \remph{fields}. The name $\DC{Con}$ is to suggest
``Constructor''. For example, we could represent a list using tagged
unions:

\begin{itemize}
\item $\DC{Con}\:0()$ representing the empty list.
\item $\DC{Con}\:1(\vx,\:\vxs)$ representing a cons cell, where $\vx$
  is the element and $\vxs$ is the tail of the list.
\end{itemize}

Tagged unions are inspected either using field projection ($\vt!\vi$
projects the $\vi$th field from a tagged union $\vt$) or by case
analysis. For example, to append two lists:

\DM{
\AR{
\VV{append}(\vxs,\vys)\:=
\RW{case}\:\vxs\:\RW{of}\\
\hg\hg\begin{array}{ll}
\DC{Con}\:0()&\cq\:\vys\\
\DC{Con}\:1(\vx,\vxs')&\cq\:\DC{Con}\:1(\vx,\VV{append}(\vxs',\vys))
\end{array}
}
}

\subsubsection*{Evaluation Strategy}

By default, expressions are evaluated eagerly (in applicative order),
i.e. arguments to functions and tagged unions are evaluated
immediately, left to right. Evaluation can instead be delayed using
the $\RW{lazy}$ construct. An expression $\RW{lazy}(\vt)$ will not be
evaluated until it is required by one of:

\begin{itemize}
\item Inspection in a $\RW{case}$ expression or the condition in an
  $\RW{if}$ statement.
\item Field projection.
\item Being passed to a foreign function.
\item Explicit evaluation with $\RW{effect}$. This evaluates
  side-effecting code (and does not update the thunk).
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Using $\RW{lazy}$ we can build an infinite list of values, ensuring
that a value will not be added to the list until it is needed:

\DM{
\AR{
\VV{countFrom}(\vx)\: = \:\DC{Cons}\:1(\vx,\:\RW{lazy}(\VV{countFrom}(\vx+1)))
}
}

We can safely write a function which takes the first $\vn$ values from
such a list, since the tail of the list will not be evaluated until it
is needed:

\DM{
\AR{
\VV{take}(\vn,\vxs)\: =\: \RW{case}\:\vxs\:\RW{of}\\
\hg\begin{array}{ll}
\DC{Con}\:0() & \cq\: \DC{Con}\:0() \\
\DC{Con}\:1(\vx,\vxs') & \cq\: \AR{
\RW{if}\:\vn == 0\:
\RW{then}\:\DC{Con}\:0() \\
\hg\RW{else}\:\DC{Con}\:1(\vx,\VV{take}(\vn-1, \vxs'))
}
\end{array}          
\medskip
\\
\VV{vals}()\:=\:\VV{take}(10, \VV{countFrom}(1))
}
}

\subsubsection*{Higher order functions}

Finally, expressions may contain $\lambda$ and $\RW{let}$
bindings. Higher order functions such as $\VV{map}$ are also permitted:

\DM{
\AR{
\VV{map}(\vf,\vxs)\:=\:
\RW{case}\:\vxs\:\RW{of}\\
\hg\hg\begin{array}{ll}
\DC{Con}\:0() & \cq\:\DC{Con}\:0()\\
\DC{Con}\:1(\vx,\vxs') & \cq\:\DC{Con}\:1(\vf(\vx), \VV{map}(\vf,\vxs'))
\end{array}
\medskip
\\
\VV{evens}(\vn)\:=\:\RW{let}\:\AR{\VV{nums}\:=\:
\VV{take}(\vn, \VV{countFrom}(1))\:\RW{in}\\
\VV{map}(\lambda\vx\SC\vx\:\times \:2, \VV{nums})
}
}
}

\subsection{Foreign Functions}

Most programs eventually need to interact with the operating
system. Epic provides a lightweight foreign function interface which
allows interaction with external C code. Each primitive type
corresponds to a C type, as shown in Table \ref{epicctypes}.  Most of
the conversions are straightforward mappings between the
languages. Otherwise, $\TC{Bool}$ is represented by an C \texttt{int},
and $\TC{Unit}$ is used for the return type of \texttt{void}
functions. $\TC{Ptr}$ is the type of pointer values originating in
C. Values can also be passed in their Epic representation
(\texttt{Closure*}) but the details are beyond the scope of this paper.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
Epic type & C Type \\
\hline
$\TC{Int}$  & \texttt{int} \\
$\TC{Char}$ & \texttt{char} \\
$\TC{Bool}$ & \texttt{int} \\
$\TC{Float}$ & \texttt{double} \\
$\TC{String}$ & \texttt{char*} \\
$\TC{Ptr}$ & \texttt{void*} \\
$\TC{Unit}$ & \texttt{void} \\
$\TC{Any}$ & \texttt{Closure*} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Epic to C type conversion}
\label{epicctypes}
\end{table}

Epic values are represented differently from C values, so argument
values must be converted before making a foreign call, and the return
value converted back. Since Epic does no type checking or inference,
a foreign call requires the argument and return types to be given
explicitly. For example, consider the C sine function:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{csin}

double sin(double x);

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{csin}

\noindent
We can call this function from Epic by giving the C name, the return
type (an Epic $\TC{Float}$) and the argument type (also an Epic
$\TC{Float}$).

\DM{
\VV{sin}(\vx)\:=\:\RW{foreign}\:\TC{Float}\:\mathtt{"sin"}\:(\vx\Hab\TC{Float})
}

\noindent
Often, dealing with foreign functions requires handling data types
which originate in C. For example, opening a file uses the
\texttt{fopen} function, which returns a pointer to the C type
\texttt{FILE}:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{cfopen}

FILE* fopen(char* filename, char* mode); 

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{cfopen}

\noindent
We can use this function directly from Epic, using the $\TC{Ptr}$
type:

\DM{
\VV{fopen}(\vf,\vm)\:=\:\RW{foreign}\:\TC{Ptr}\:\mathtt{"fopen"}(\vf:\TC{String},
\vm:\TC{String})
}

\noindent
The $\TC{String}$ annotations in the foreign call ensure that the Epic
string representation will be passed to C as a \texttt{char*}. Other
file operations, such as writing or closing the file can refer
directly to the file handle returned as a $\TC{Ptr}$: 

\DM{
\begin{array}{ll}
\VV{fputs}(\vx,\vh) & =\:\RW{foreign}\:\TC{Unit}\:\mathtt{"fputs"}(\vx:\TC{String},\vh:\TC{Ptr})\\
\VV{fclose}(\vh) & =\:\RW{foreign}\:\TC{Unit}\:\mathtt{"fclose"}(\vh:\TC{Ptr})\\
\end{array}
}

\noindent
Many foreign functions have side effects (in particular, I/O). Epic
assumes that the high level language will arrange for side-effecting
functions to be evaluated in the correct order. For this reason, it is
important to understand the default evaluation strategy.

\subsubsection*{A note on memory management}

When working with foreign functions it is important to consider how
external code interacts with the garbage collector. In particular,
\remph{copying} garbage collectors can be problematic because there is
a danger that a value referenced by external code may be moved, and
there is no way for the collector to identify and move every reference
in this code. This could cause a problem if the external library uses
callbacks to Epic functions.

The current implementation uses a non-moving collector, the Boehm
conservative collector for C~\cite{boehm-gc}, thus avoiding any
problems. However, this is not a long term solution, as this kind of
collector does not generally perform well for programs which create a
lot of short lived objects (of which most functional programs are an
example). Any future garbage collector for Epic will need to ensure
that values originating in Epic are not copied once passed to foreign
code.

\subsection{Low Level Features}

Epic emphasises control over safety, and therefore provides some low
level features to give language implementations more control over
generated code.  A high level language may wish to use these features
in some performance critical contexts, whether for sequencing side
effects, implementing optimisations, or to provide run-time support
code.

\subsubsection*{Imperative features}

Epic allows sequencing, $\RW{while}$ loops and variable update. Since
the default evaluation strategy is strict, sequencing can be achieved
simply with \RW{let} bindings, discarding the variable:

\DM{
\begin{array}{llll}
\VV{main}\:= &
\RW{let}\:\_ & = &
\VV{putStr}(\mbox{\texttt{"Enter your name: "}})\:\RW{in}\\
& \RW{let}\:\vn & = &
\VV{getStr}()\:\RW{in} \\
& & & \VV{putStrLn}(\VV{append}(\mbox{\texttt{"Hello "}}, \vn))\\
\end{array}\\
}

\noindent
We can also use \RW{while} loops, and update variables. Variable
update ($\vx\: :=\:\vt_1\:\RW{in}\:\vt_2$) behaves like a $\RW{let}$
binding, except that $\vx$ must already be in scope, and the previous
value of $\vx$ is updated to be $\vt_2$. We can use these to write an
imperative program such as the following, which prints numbers from 1
to 10:

\DM{
\VV{main}\:=\:\RW{let}\:\AR{
\vc\:=\:0\:\RW{in}\\
\RW{while}\:(\vc<10)\:\\
\hg(\vc:=\vc+1\:\RW{in}\\
\hg\:\VV{putStrLn}(\VV{intToSring}(\vc)))
}
}

\subsubsection*{Memory allocation}

The $\RW{malloc}$ construct allows manual memory allocation. The
behaviour of $\RW{malloc}\:\vn\:\vt$ is to create a fixed pool of
$\vn$ bytes, and allocate only from this pool when evaluating
$\vt$. When evaluation is complete, the pool is freed, and the result
copied. This can be valuable where an upper bound on memory usage can
be predicted accurately (whether manually or automatically) as it
reduces the garbage collection overhead.

\subsection{Haskell API}

The primary interface to Epic is through a Haskell API, which is used
to build expressions and programs, and to compile them to executables.
Implementing a compiler for a high level language is then a matter of
converting the abstract syntax of a high level program into an Epic
program, through these ``compiler combinators'', and implementing any
run-time support as Epic functions.

\subsubsection*{Programs and expressions}

The API allows the building of Epic programs with an Embedded Domain
Specific Language (EDSL) style interface, i.e. we try to exploit
Haskell's syntax as far as possible. There are several
possible representations of Epic expressions.
\texttt{Expr} is the internal abstract representation, and
\texttt{Term} is a representation which carries a name supply. We have
a type class \texttt{EpicExpr} which provides a function \texttt{term}
for building a concrete expression using a name supply:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{exprclass}

type Term = State Int Expr

class EpicExpr e where
    term :: e -> Term

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{exprclass}

There are straightforward instances of \texttt{EpicExpr} for the
internal representation \texttt{Expr} and \texttt{Term}. There is also
an instance for \texttt{String}, which parses concrete syntax, which
is beyond the scope of this paper. More interestingly, we can build an
instance of the type class which allows Haskell functions to be used
to build Epic functions.  This means we can use Haskell names for Epic
references, and not need to worry about scoping or ambiguous name
choices. In the following instance definition, \texttt{R} and
\texttt{Lam} are internal representations for references and $\lambda$
bindings respectively.

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{exprinstance}

instance EpicExpr e => EpicExpr (Expr -> e) where
    term f = do var <- get
                put (var+1)
                let arg = MN "evar" var
                e' <- term (f (R arg))
                return (Lam arg e')

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{exprinstance}

\noindent
\textbf{Aside:}
Internally, names are separated into user supplied names, and names
invented by the machine. In this way, we can be sure that machine
generated names will never clash with a user defined name. The
\texttt{String} argyment to \texttt{MN} allows us to give an
annotation (\texttt{"evar"} here) which says where the name arose.

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{epicnames}

data Name = UN String     -- user name
          | MN String Int -- machine generated name

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{epicnames}

\noindent
If we have explicit names for arguments, it can be more convenient to
pass these to Epic directly rather than to use the name supply. We
provide an instance to allow a user to give argument names explicitly:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{exprnamed}

instance EpicExpr e => EpicExpr ([Name], e) where
    term (ns, e) = do 
        e' <- term e
        foldM (\e n -> return (Lam n e)) e' ns

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{exprnamed}

\noindent
Both forms, using Haskell functions or explicit names, can be mixed
freely in an expression. A program is a collection of named Epic
expressions built using the \texttt{EpicExpr} class:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{eprogs}

type Program = [EpicDecl]

data EpicDecl = forall e. EpicExpr e => EpicFn Name e
              | Include String 
              | Link    String    
              | CType   String   

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{eprogs}

\noindent
Declarations are usually just a function (\texttt{EpicFn}) but can
also be used to include C header files (\texttt{Include}), declare
libraries for linking (\texttt{Link}) and declare types for exporting
as C types (\texttt{CType}). These additional declarations are useful
when interfacing with external code.

The library provides a number of built-in definitions for some common
operations such as outputting strings and converting data types:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{bdefs}

basic_defs :: [EpicDecl]

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{bdefs}

\noindent
In this paper we use $\VV{putStr}$ and $\VV{putStrLn}$ for outputting
strings, $\VV{append}$ for concatenating strings, and
$\VV{intToString}$ for integer to string conversion.
We can compile a collection of definitions to an executable, or simply
execute them directly. Execution begins with the function called
\texttt{"main"} --- Epic reports an error if this function is not
defined:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{compepic}

compile :: Program -> FilePath -> IO ()
run     :: Program -> IO ()

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{compepic}

\subsubsection*{Building expressions}

We have seen how to build $\lambda$ bindings with the
\texttt{EpicExpre} class, using either Haskell's $\lambda$ or pairing
explicitly bound names with their scope. We now add further
sub-expressions. Firstly, we introduce functions for referring to
explicitly bound names --- \texttt{ref} build a reference to a
\texttt{Name}, \texttt{name} converts a string into the internal form,
and \texttt{fn} combines these operations.

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{nameapi}

ref  :: Name -> Term
name :: String -> Name

fn   :: String -> Term

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{nameapi}

\noindent
We would refer to the $\VV{putStrLn}$ function, for example, with
\texttt{fn~"putStrLn"}.
Constants are constructed using the following functions:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{constapi}

str   :: String -> Term
int   :: Int    -> Term
char  :: Char   -> Term
float :: Float  -> Term
bool  :: Bool   -> Term

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{constapi}

The general form of functions which build expressions is to create a
\texttt{Term} --- i.e. an expression which manages its own name supply
--- by combining arbitrary Epic expressions (i.e. instances of
\texttt{EpicExpr}). For example, to apply a function to an argument,
we provide an \texttt{EpicExpr} for the function and the argument,
yielding a \texttt{Term}:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{appapi}

infixl 5 @@
(@@) :: (EpicExpr f, EpicExpr a) => f -> a -> Term

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{appapi}

Since \texttt{Term} itself is an instance of \texttt{EpicExpr}, we can
apply a function to several arguments through nested applications of
\texttt{@@}, which associates to the left as with normal Haskell
function application. It is easy to build partially applied functions
this way. 

%Distinction between Haskell application and Epic
%application (\texttt{@@}).

We have several arithmetic operators, including arithmetic, comparison
and bitwise operators. Since there are different representations for
integers and floating point values, and Epic does no type inference,
there are separate versions for integers and floating point values.

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{opsapi}

plus_, minus_, times_, divide_,    :: Op
plusF_, minusF_, timesF_, divideF_ :: Op
lt_, lte_, gt_, gte_,              :: Op
ltF_, lteF_, gtF_, gteF_,          :: Op
shiftl_, shiftr_                   :: Op

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{opsapi}

A convention we follow in the API is that Epic keywords and primitive
operators are represented by a Haskell function with an underscore
suffix. This convention arises because we cannot use Haskell keywords
such as \texttt{if}, \texttt{let} and \texttt{case} as function names.
For consistency, we have extended the convention to all functions and
operators. \texttt{if...then...else} expressions are built using the
\texttt{if\_} function:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{ifexp}

if_ :: (EpicExpr a, EpicExpr t, EpicExpr e) =>
       a -> t -> e -> Term

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{ifexp}

For $\RW{let}$ bindings, we can either use higher order syntax or bind
an explicit name. To achieve this, as before, we implement a type
class and instances which support both:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{letapi}

class LetExpr e where
    let_ :: EpicExpr val => val -> e -> State Int Expr

instance EpicExpr sc => LetExpr (Name, sc)
instance                LetExpr (Expr -> Term)

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{letapi}

Occasionally, especially in imperative code, we use $\RW{let}$
bindings for sequencing actions. We provide a shorthand for this
common case:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{seqapi}

(+>) :: (EpicExpr c) => c -> Term -> Term
(+>) c k = let_ c (\x -> k)

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{seqapi}

To build a constructor form, we apply a constructor with an integer
\remph{tag} to its arguments. We build a constructor using the
\texttt{con\_} function, and provide a shorthand \texttt{tuple\_} for
the common case where the tag can be ignored --- as the name suggests,
this happens when building tuples and records:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{conapi}

con_   :: Int -> Term
tuple_ :: Term

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{conapi}

To call a foreign function, we provide the external name as a
\texttt{String}. Unlike normal function application, partial
application is not allowed --- all arguments must be provided.  The
caller must also provide the expected return type, and state the type
of each argument so that values can be marshalled to and from C
correctly:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{foreignapi}

foreign_, :: EpicExpr e => 
             Type -> String -> [(e, Type)] -> Term

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{foreignapi}

\subsubsection*{Case analysis}

To inspect constructor forms, to deconstruct tuples, we build
$\RW{case}$ expressions. A case expression chooses one of the
alternative executions path depending on the value of the scrutinee,
which can be any Epic expression:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{caseapi}

case_ :: EpicExpr e => e -> [Case] -> Term

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{caseapi}

\noindent
The scrutinee is matched against each branch, in order. To match
against a constructor form, we use the same trick as we did for
$\lambda$-bindings, either allowing Haskell to manage to scope of
constructor arguments, or giving names explicitly to arguments, or a
mixture:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{conalt}

class Alternative e where
    mkAlt :: Tag -> e -> Case

instance Alternative Expr
instance Alternative Term

instance Alternative e => Alternative (Expr -> e)
instance Alternative e => Alternative ([Name], e)

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{conalt}

We can build case alternatives for constructor forms, tuples, or
integer constants, as well as a default case if all other alternatives
fail to match. In each of the following, \texttt{e} is an expression
which gives the argument bindings, if any, and the right hand side of
the match.

(We have to use \texttt{Alternative} rather than
\texttt{EpicExpr} to ensure that we get arguments bound in the match,
rather than a $\lambda$ binding on the right hand side).

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{altsapi}

tuple       :: Alternative e =>        e -> Case
constcase   :: EpicExpr e    => Int -> e -> Case
defaultcase :: EpicExpr e    =>        e -> Case

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{altsapi}

\subsubsection*{A complete example}

We have enough to write a simple example now. Here is the $\VV{map}$
function from earlier. Note the distinction between \texttt{con\_},
used to build a constructor, and \texttt{con}, used to introduce a
match alternative.

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{mapex}

map_ :: Expr -> Expr -> Term
map_ f xs = case_ xs 
   [con 0 (con_ 0),
    con 1 (\ (x :: Expr) (xs' :: Expr)
      -> con_ 1 @@ (f @@ x) @@ (fn "map" @@ f @@ xs'))]

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{mapex}

In the recursive call, we refer to the function by an Epic name,
rather than a Haskell name. So we need to ensure that these names are
consistent. We can declare that the name \texttt{"map"} refers to the
definition \texttt{map\_}:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{mapdef}

mapDef :: EpicDecl
mapDef = EpicFn (name "map") map_

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{mapdef}

We have a function to add up all the integers in a list:

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{sumex}

sum_ :: Expr -> Term
sum_ xs = case_ xs
           [con 0 (int 0),
            con 1 (\ (x :: Expr) (xs' :: Expr) ->
                       op_ plus_ x (fn "sum" @@ xs'))]

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{sumex}

This constructs the Epic function:

\DM{
\AR{
\VV{sum}(\vxs)\:=\:
\RW{case}\:\vxs\:\RW{of}\\
\hg\hg\begin{array}{ll}
\DC{Con}\:0() & \cq\:0\\
\DC{Con}\:1(\vx,\vxs') & \cq\:\vx\:+\:\VV{sum}(\vxs')
\end{array}

We write a test funtion which doubles all the elements in a list, then
computes the sum of the result. Note that we have written the function
argument to map as an inline function. The main program simply outputs
the result of this function.

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{testex}

test_ = fn "sum" @@ 
       (fn "map" @@ \ (x :: Expr) -> op_ times_ x (int 2) 
                 @@ (con_ 1 @@ (int 5) @@
                    (con_ 1 @@ (int 10) @@ con_ 0)))

main_ = fn "putStrLn" @@ (fn "intToString" @@ fn "test")

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{testex}

\texttt{test\_} constructs the Epic function:

\DM{
\VV{test}\:=\:\VV{sum}(\VV{map}
\AR{
(\lambda\vx.x\:\times\:2, \\
\:\DC{Con}\:1(5,\DC{Con}\:1(10,\DC{Con}\:0()))))
}
}

Finally, we give a complete list of definitions, mapping concrete
names to the functions we've written.

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{alldefs}

defs = basic_defs ++ [EpicFn (name "main") main_, 
                      EpicFn (name "map") map_,
                      EpicFn (name "sum") sum_,
                      EpicFn (name "test") test_]

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{alldefs}

To compile and run this, we use the \texttt{run} function from the
Epic API, which builds an executable and runs it. The following
program outputs \texttt{30}.

\begin{SaveVerbatim}{mainex}

main = run defs

\end{SaveVerbatim}
\useverb{mainex}
