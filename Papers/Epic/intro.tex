\section{Introduction}

Lots of backends for functional languages,
e.g. STG~\cite{evalpush,stg,llvm-haskell}, ABC~\cite{abc-machine}.
But they aren't simple enough that they are easy to bolt on to a new
language. Either too low level, or an interface isn't exposed, or
where an interface is exposed, there are constraints on the type
system. So things like Agda~\cite{norell-thesis} have resorted to
generating Haskell with unsafeCoerce.

Epic originally written for Epigram~\cite{levitation} (the name is
short for ``\textbf{Epi}gram \textbf{C}ompiler''). Now used by
Idris~\cite{idris-plpv}, also as an experimental back end for Agda.
