\section{Implementation}

How it's implemented is not really important to the user --- a
compiler can target Epic without knowing, and we could drop in a new
back end at any time in principle.

There is currently one back end, but more are planned. Compiled via
C. Garbage collection with Boehm~\cite{boehm-gc},
\texttt{\%memory}. (Note that a non-moving collector makes things
easier for foreign functions, but may not be the best choice in the
long run).

Later plans: compile via LLVM, allow plug in garbage collectors
(important for embedded systems, device drivers, operating system
services, for example).
